# LibrarySystem
* Library System original written in C (none of the headers created were used in the C version)
* Now being rewritten in C++ and Java
* This was originally done for my CAPE Computer Science Internal Assessment/School Based Assessment
* Can also be implemented in Python in the future (Maybe like a webapp using flask or django)
* Computer Science 6B3 (Brandon Hinds).docx is for Unit 1 of CAPE Computer Science (2014)
* Computer Science 6A2 (Brandon Hinds).docx is for Unit 2 of CAPE Computer Science (2015)

# Important
If you are a CAPE Computer Science student please do not copy and submit this as your own work. CXC will know and you run the risk
of being dealt with by the council and I will not be held responsible.
